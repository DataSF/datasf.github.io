The City and County of San Francisco (&quot;City&quot;) is committed to protecting the privacy rights of individuals, as enumerated in Article 1 of the California Constitution and other federal, state and local laws. This privacy policy applies to the DataSF website ( [datasf.org](http://datasf.org/)).

## Public disclosure

Laws exist to ensure that government is open and that the public has a right to access appropriate records and information possessed by the City. At the same time, there are exceptions to the public&#39;s right to access public records. These exceptions serve various needs including maintaining the privacy of individuals. Federal, state and local laws provide exceptions.

All information collected at this site becomes public record that may be subject to inspection and copying by the public, unless an exemption in law exists. In the event of a conflict between this Privacy Policy and law governing the disclosure of records, the applicable law requiring disclosure will control.
