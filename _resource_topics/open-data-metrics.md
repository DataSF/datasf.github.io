One of the most frequent questions we get asked about open data is - why?Most folks understand the need for transparency and openness in government, but some question the need to invest the effort in a comprehensive open data effort.

And to be perfectly fair - very few folks have measured the impact of open data. Since we love being data-driven, we put a bunch of thought into how to measure open data. The documents below guide our approach and you can read our blog post “[How to Measure Open Data](https://datasf.org/blog/how-to-measure-open-data/)” for an overview.
