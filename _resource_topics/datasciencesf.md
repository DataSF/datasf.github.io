As part of our [DataScienceSF service](https://datasf.org/science/), we use a variety of resources and tools during project solicitation, selection, scoping and execution.

Our DataScienceSF service is run in 2 cohorts annually. Departments apply during the solicitation process. This is when we pitch the service via brownbags, invited presentations and other forums.

Other resource below support project execution. In particular, the project charter helps us scope and manage our projects.
