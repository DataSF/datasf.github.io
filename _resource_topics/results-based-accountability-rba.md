Results Based Accountability (RBA) is a methodology you can use to help manage the performance of your program. It's a set of practices that let you define what you are trying to achieve and how to measure your performance, that is:

1. What is the high level result or outcome you want to achieve?
2. What are the indicators or benchmarks that quantify that result or outcome?
3. For the programs or services that support the result or outcome, how do you measure performance?

For performance metrics for programs and services, RBA helps you define three sets of metrics:

1. How much did we do? (activity metrics)
2. How well did we do it? (quality metrics)
3. Is anyone better off as a result? (impact metrics)

At DataSF, we use RBA, together with our logic model, to track performance of each of our programs. [Read our blog post on how we do this](/blog/how-to-measure-open-data/).
