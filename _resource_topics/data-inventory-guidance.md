The resources here provide a mix of guidance, templates and examples to help data coordinators. You can read more about the process in the blog post, [5 Ways to Scale the Mountain of Data in Your Organization](/blog/5-ways-to-scale-mountain-of-data/).

The [dataset inventory provides a list of data maintained by departments](https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Dataset-Inventory/y8fp-fbf5) and is collected in accordance with Chapter 22D of the Administrative Code. Additionally, when data can be published to the portal, a link to the public dataset is made available in that inventory. Data Coordinators, appointed by their departments, are responsible for annual inventory updates.
