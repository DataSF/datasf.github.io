##Who we're looking for
We are looking for someone who can learn the contours of a complex and large organization and likes hard, meaty challenges. We are not looking for superhero lone wolfs, but thoughtful, empathetic individuals with a set of broad tools. We are a user-oriented team and we apply that in all of our work. Our users are diverse and varied and come from inside and outside the organization; willingness to take time to learn their needs and perspective is a needed trait.

 - Comfort with front end development and web standards
 - Willingness and ability to learn new tools as needed, including programming languages
 - Familiar with the concepts of open data
 - Comfort creating, following, standardizing, and automating business processes to support program management
 - 3+ years experience in related work
 - BS/BA in GIS, computer science, engineering, user-centered design or related field

##Skills we prefer
We would love applicants who also meet the following:

 - Passionate about improving government through open data
 - Enthusiastic about empowering use of data, with a focus on mapping, within and without the City
 - Advanced experience with front end development
 - Experience with back end development and database management
 - Experience training non-technical users to use technology to support their work
 - Experience with Feature Manipulation Engine (FME) from SAFE or similar ETL toolkits or frameworks
