Luke loves getting people excited to learn. He uses programs like Tableau and Power BI to make data come to life, helping people see and understand the impact of their work, find opportunities to try new ideas, and communicate with the public about how their government is doing. Since 2015 he has partnered with teams at nearly a dozen departments to help them improve their service designs, policies, and use of data. Luke worked with a variety of nonprofits and service groups before joining the City, including the Urban Institute where he conducted research on local governance and service outcomes, and the social impact strategy firm Mission Measurement where he helped clients improve their management and performance of global development programs. He started his career with the City as an intern in 2007 and a City Hall Fellow in 2010-11. He holds an M.A. in International Development Studies from George Washington University and a B.S. in Political Science from Santa Clara University, with special training in business process improvement, nonprofit management, performance measurement and organizational learning.
