Catherine has worked in a variety of public sector contexts: in the non-profit world with the Citizen’s Planning Association of Santa Barbara, in State government at the California Legislative Analyst’s Office working on state budget analysis, and at the Federal level working on sustainability in HUD-funded housing at the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Since joining the Controller’s Office, Catherine has been involved in a variety of projects, and she is particularly proud of the work she has done with the San Francisco Business Portal Team in improving the business permitting processes required for opening a new restaurant in San Francisco. She is eager to see how process improvement can be integrated throughout the City. Catherine has an MA in Public Policy from the Sol Price School of Public Policy at University of Southern California.
