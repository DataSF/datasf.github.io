Prior to joining the City in 2012, Ellen advocated for socially responsible public procurement policy with the Responsible Purchasing Network and supported the development of worker-owned businesses with Prospera in Oakland, California.&nbsp; Ellen holds a master’s degree in public policy from the Goldman School at the University of California, Berkeley and a bachelor’s degree in Development Studies from Brown University.
