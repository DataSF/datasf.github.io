David’s background is in data analysis, transportation planning, and engineering. After working in economic consulting, David pursued his graduate studies in transportation, and has worked on data analysis in transportation at university research centers, in consulting, and in the public sector in San Francisco and New York City. While he will always be particularly fond of using data analysis to improve transit travel time and reliability, he’s excited to be an instructor with Data Academy and help all departments uncover answers to their questions more efficient and effective data analysis. David has a Master of City Planning and MS Transportation Engineering from UC Berkeley, and BAs in Economics and French, also from UC Berkeley. (Go bears\!)
