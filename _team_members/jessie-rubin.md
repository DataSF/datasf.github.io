Jessie loves watching Data Academy students get excited about using analytical tools to improve the efficiency of department operations and the efficacy of City services.  She uses Tableau, Excel, and Access on a daily basis while working on projects that serve to benefit a wide array of City service areas, such as public safety, public health, and recreation.  Prior to joining the Controller’s Office, Jessie worked for the City’s Office of the Public Defender as a paralegal.  She also spent three years working with nonprofits in Central America – as an organizational development consultant in Panama and a Fulbright Scholar in Nicaragua.  She has an MA in Public Administration from the Maxwell School of Syracuse University and a BA in Government from Smith College.  She is also certified as a Project Management Professional (PMP).
