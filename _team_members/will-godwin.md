Will works as an epidemiologist at the San Francisco Department of Public Health. He supports data-driven advance planning and analysis for the emergency preparedness and response branch, as well as the EMS agency. This includes building public-facing dashboards, conducting research for hazard assessments, and managing projects that increase interoperability between healthcare and public health data infrastructure. Will’s ideal Saturday morning is a warm bowl of oats and a slow cruise through the Presidio. He holds a bachelor’s degree from Emory University and a master’s in public health from the University of Washington.
