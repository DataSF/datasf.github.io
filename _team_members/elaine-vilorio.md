Elaine first developed an appreciation for data at Amherst College, where she got a bachelor’s degree in Black Studies and Latin American & Latinx Studies. She’s worked primarily with R but has experience with SPSS, which she used during her time at the University of Michigan’s Inter-University Consortium for Social and Political Research. There, she cleaned and processed Survey of Consumer Attitudes and Behavior data and researched to what extent the race or ethnicity of teachers affects student outcomes. She hopes to further refine her R skills and become proficient in Tableau and Power BI.

Elaine is a San Francisco Fellow for HOPE SF, a unique affordable housing initiative between the Mayor’s Office and the Mayor’s Office of Housing and Community Development.
