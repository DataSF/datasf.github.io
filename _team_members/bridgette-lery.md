Bridgette Lery, MSW, PhD leads research and evaluation for the San Francisco Human Services Agency. She uses administrative data to plan, implement, and understand the effects of child welfare and other human service interventions using a continuous quality improvement approach. Much of that work includes using linked data such as child welfare, homelessness, juvenile probation, mental health, and the U.S. Census. Some current projects include, (1) an ACF-funded randomized controlled trial of housing and intensive services to homeless, child welfare involved families, (2) implementation and evaluation of Project 500, a cross-system, two-generation anti-poverty program, (3) local planning and evaluation of interventions implemented under California’s Title IV-E Waiver Demonstration, and (3) co-leading an ACF-funded university partnership grant to train MSW students in the use of evidence for better decision making. Bridgette holds a PhD from the University of California at Berkeley’s School of Social Welfare, an MSW from Columbia University, and a BA in psychology from the University of California at Santa Cruz.
