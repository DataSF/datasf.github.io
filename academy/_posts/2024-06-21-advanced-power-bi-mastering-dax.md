## Prerequisites

***Note:** this is an advanced course and is geared towards Power BI users who are already familiar with intermediate topics such as data modeling and basic DAX expressions or familiarity with other coding/ programmatic languages (i.e. R, Python, SQL).*

The course is aimed at power users of Power BI, Power Pivot for Excel, and at Analysis Services developers that want to learn and master the DAX language.

Completion of Data Academy’s Intro to PowerBI and Intermediate Power BI courses is required. This course assumes a good working knowledge of how PowerBI works. Heavy use is made of the query editor and familiarity is assumed. This course is not designed as a refresher course, but as the next stage in training for advanced Power BI analysts.
