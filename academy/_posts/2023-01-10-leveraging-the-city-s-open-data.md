## About this course

This course helps you unlock features of the internal Citywide Data Platform and the public-facing open data portal to improve your own data workflows.

Have you heard of the [City's open data portal](https://data.sfgov.org)? Even if you haven't, you should know that it's much more than a transparency website and catalog of data. It actually has a powerful set of features you can leverage in your own data work. This course is most useful for those who want to use data from the portal, or want to understand how your department's data can be loaded to the portal. It will help you to unlock data portal features to improve your own data workflows.

The class assumes you have working knowledge of Excel and a curiosity to learn new tools.
