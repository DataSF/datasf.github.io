## About this course

This workshop will leverage City of San Francisco geospatial data to demonstrate creating and editing GIS data as well as performing basic intermediate level spatial analysis techniques. These topics will include: Zonal statistics, spatial joins, and attribute field calculations. By completing this course workshop you will be able to create and edit shapefiles and geodatabases, join separate datasets together such as Restaurant Health Scores to areas such as census tracts, and calculate values within GIS data like number of restaurants with high health scores in a census tract, proximity to nearest emergency response infrastructure, and length of bike lanes in a particular neighborhood.
