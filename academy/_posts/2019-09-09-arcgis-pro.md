## About this course

Unleash the power of ArcGIS Pro\! This four-hour workshop is designed for both new GIS users and those who are familiar with Arc Map or QGIS. We will become familiar with core GIS functionality in ArcGIS Pro and explore the ease with which Pro accomplishes advanced geoprocessing functions and its efficient data management tools.

The class will consist of four short lecture/demonstrations paired with self-paced exercises.

## What you'll learn in this course

By the end of this workshop you will be able to:

* Tell a story and solve a problem with a map;
* Complete basic topology editing and integrate data from the City Open Data portal and other open source data sources.

For students interested in extending their skills, we will explore:

* Tot spot analysis;
* Basic ArcPy commands and scripting GeoJSON feeds into an ArcGIS Pro project.
