        <h2>What we do</h2>
        <p>Our mission is to empower use of the City’s data. Our core product is <a href="http://data.sfgov.org" alt="SF Open Data Portal">SF OpenData</a>, our official open data portal. Launched in 2009, the data portal contains hundreds of city datasets
          for use by developers, analysts, residents, and more. We believe open data has the potential to support a range of outcomes from increased quality of life, more efficient government services, better decisions, and new businesses and services.</p>

        <p>We’ve also learned that enabling data use in San Francisco is about more than simply publishing datasets on SF OpenData. That’s why we’ve launched programs like the Data Academy, a training program which helps increase internal City capacity to
          effectively use our data.</p>

        <p>And we’re extending the open data approach beyond the simple publication of datasets to using open data as a means to reveal and unpack complex areas such as affordable housing, homelessness, and economic development. Many areas of government
          service touch multiple departments through multiple programs. Our approach is to identify the various programs and their administrative data and then publish that data along with the program context. We call these strategic releases and our
          theory is that this will yield quick value from open datasets that may otherwise be released disparately and without broader context.</p>

        <h3>Data Coordinators</h3> Our data coordinators are responsible for coordinating the implementation of the open data work in their departments. Without their department knowledge and help, SF OpenData would not be possible.
        <h3>Controller’s Citywide Services Auditor (CSA)</h3>
        <p>We’ve partnered with the performance team in CSA on a variety of projects, including the Data Academy, Stat program research, and internal data sharing. Big shoutouts go to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sherman Luk for his help creating and building out the Data Academy</li>
          <li>Jessie Rubin and Andrew Ju for their excellent research and work on best practices in performance management and “Stat” programs</li>
          <li>Kyle Patterson, Laura Marshall, and Kyra Sikora for their amazing research, convening and strategy work to promote effective internal data sharing</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Awesome Interns</h3>
        <p>We’ve had the opportunity to work with some amazing people on a short term basis. Their efforts have been key to moving some of our projects forward.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Laura Gerhardt, Spring 2015. Laura has recently joined us as part of completing her Master’s in Public Policy at UC Berkeley. She’s working to help us analyze and publish housing inspections data across three City departments.</li>
          <li>Charlotte Hill, Dan Wilcox, Evgenia Likhovtseva, and Marcelo Milanello, Spring 2015. As part of a client class project, this graduate team at UC Berkeley is helping us investigate options for data or technology partnerships with external groups.</li>
          <li>Erica Finkle, Summer 2014. Erica joined us in Summer 2014 and provided the core research and basis for our project on streamlined internal data sharing. In a few short weeks, she reviewed and summarized the privacy laws facing SF, reviewed best
            practices in other jurisdictions, and provided a set of recommendations. Her work was put to immediate use and accelerated our learning curve.</li>
          <li>Peri Weisberg, Summer 2014. Peri joined us in Summer 2014 and hit the ground running by informing the data categories on SF OpenData, helping us identify the best data licensing approach, and surveying metadata practices. Her core project was
            creating an evaluation framework for our open data program - something that had not been created to date. Most of her work is available on our resources page.</li>
