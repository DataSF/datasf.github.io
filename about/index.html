        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Our mission is to empower use of data. At DataSF, we seek to transform the way the City works through the use of data. We believe use of data and evidence can improve our operations and the services we provide. This ultimately leads to increased quality of life and work for San Francisco residents, employers, employees and visitors.</p>
        <h2 class="services__title">Our Vision</h2>
        <p>We are a data-driven City. Leadership and employees use data to continuously improve City services and operations. City staff has the support, skills and capacity to collect, manage, and use data effectively and efficiently. Our data is understood, documented and of high quality. Our data infrastructure provides data that is usable, timely, and accessible. Published data supports broad and unanticipated uses of City Data and supports trust, transparency and accountability. </p>
        <h2>How We Work</h2>       
        <ol>
<li><b>Say no to perfection and fail early and often.</b> Do not make perfect the enemy of good. Use small experiments and learn from failures.</li>
<li><b>Plan for the future and seek institutional homes.</b> Solve problems in a way that creates infrastructure for the future. Find a full-time home for what works.</li>
<li><b>Use long division.</b> If a problem seems too big, break it into manageable bits. There’s always a way to move something forward.</li>
<li><b>No ugly, old IT.</b> Use modern and lightweight tools. Make designs beautiful and inviting but also a little fun.</li>
<li><b>Use storytelling and data.</b> Find the people in the data and tell their story. Data without stories is just academic.</li>
<li><b>Put people, design and needs first (data and technology second).</b> Start with empathy and use design to guide our work.</li>
<li><b>Continuously learn and listen with humility.</b> Learn from ourselves and others and build on existing work. “Not invented here” attitudes prohibited.</li>
<li><b>Start with problems, move to opportunities.</b> Start with people's needs and problems and use the chance to demonstrate cool, new stuff for the future.</li>
<li><b>Be friendly and have fun.</b> Sometimes our work is tough. Take time to breathe, celebrate progress and recognize that we get to work on amazing problems.</li>
<li><b>If we don’t start now, we’ll never get there.</b> Don’t look back in five years and think “if we had just…”. Every shady street started with a row of saplings.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Charlie Moffett, Summer 2017.  Charlie did the foundation research for what became the Ethics and Algorithm toolkit.</li>
          <li>Sam Dorward, Fall 2015-Spring 2016. Sam joined us as part of an externship through Bain Consulting and knocked it out of the park conducting analytics work on tax compliance, fire inspections and evictions and created Advanced Excel for Data Academy.</li>
          <li>Christina Malamut, Summer 2015. Christina joined us to help us research what it would take to improve public records requests in San Francisco, individual access to private data, and data about homelessness.</li>
          <li>Laura Gerhardt, Spring 2015. Laura joined us as part of completing her Master’s in Public Policy at UC Berkeley. She researched and assessed how to best realize the value in housing inspections data across three City departments.</li>
          <li>Charlotte Hill, Dan Wilcox, Evgenia Likhovtseva, and Marcelo Milanello, Spring 2015. As part of a client class project, this graduate team at UC Berkeley investigated options for data or technology partnerships with external groups.</li>
          <li>Erica Finkle, Summer 2014. Erica joined us in Summer 2014 and provided the core research and basis for our project on streamlined internal data sharing. In a few short weeks, she reviewed and summarized the privacy laws facing SF, reviewed best practices in other jurisdictions, and provided a set of recommendations. Her work was put to immediate use and accelerated our learning curve.</li>
          <li>Peri Weisberg, Summer 2014. Peri joined us in Summer 2014 and hit the ground running by informing the data categories on SF OpenData, helping us identify the best data licensing approach, and surveying metadata practices. Her core project was
            creating an evaluation framework for our open data program - something that had not been created to date. Most of her work is available on our resources page.</li>
